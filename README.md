## Introduction

RubigoRouter is a simple to use, minimalistic router for Flutter projects.

In kind of a way it is Navigator 1.0 **with** direct access to the page stack.

It can also add navigation events to the controller. With these events, the controller can act on
and influence navigation while it happens.

Managing the stack was never easier. ðŸ¥³ ðŸš€

## Features

### Perform navigation

* **push**  
  Push a specific screen on the stack.
* **pop**  
  Pop the topmost screen from the stack.
* **popTo**  
  Pop directly to a specific screen.
* **replaceStack**  
  Replace the stack with a new stack.
* **remove**  
  Silently remove a screen from the stack.

### Adds coding convenience

* From your **screen widget**, you have **direct access** to the corresponding **controller**.
* From your **controller**, you have direct access to the ```RubigoRouter``` and other cool stuff (
  like the Flutter's ```Navigator```, a busyService, screen stack).

### Act on navigation events

#### Each controller that has the `RubigoControllerMixin` is informed about the following navigation events:

* **onTop(changeData)**  
  This event is called when the screen is on top of the stack.  
  Further navigation **is** allowed.
* **willShow(changeData)**  
  This event is called when the screen is on top of the stack and **will** be shown.  
  Further navigation **is not** allowed.
* **isShown(changeData)**  
  This event is called when the screen is on top of the stack and is actually shown.  
  Further navigation **is not** allowed.
* **bool mayPop()**  
  This event is called when the screen is about to be popped from the stack.  
  If you return ```false```, the pop is cancelled.  
  Further navigation **is not** allowed.

#### changeData contains the following data:

* **eventType:**  
  The event type can be push, pop, popTo or replaceStack.
* **previousScreen:**  
  This is the screen where we are coming from.
* **screenStack:**  
  This is a copy of the current screen stack.

With this data, the controller can decide what to do next, like navigate further or load data from
an asynchronous source.

#### Typical use cases

* **onTop()**  
  Navigate to other screens without the user noticing it.
* **willShow()**  
  Get data from an asynchronous source, like a local database. The screen will be shown as soon as
  the data has arrived.
* **isShown()**  
  If you want to be sure that page is shown before starting some lengthy processing. If you call
  code that is heavy on the UI thread, this makes sure that at least the page is shown before the
  processing starts.

### Know when the app is busy and absorb touch events

This is not mandatory to use, but it is a nice addition, especially for Line of Business apps.

The ```RubigoRouter``` holds a ```RubigoBusyService```. Whenever navigation is in progress, or when
the app executes some code in a ```busyWrapper```, the app marks itself as **busy**.

When the app is **busy** and the ```RubigoBusyWidget``` is used, all touch events are absorbed. This
protects your app in a simple and easy to reason about way.

## Getting started

At the time of writing, this package requires:

* dart sdk: 3.0.0 or greater
* flutter version 3.10.0 or greater

### Setting up the app

Create an enum to uniquely identify each an every screen.

```dart
enum Screens {
  splashScreen,
  s100,
  s200,
}
```

Create a list that combines the enum, with a widget and a controller.

```dart
// holder = your favorite service locator and/or dependency injection package.
// It's important that the controllers are registered as singletons, unless you
// know what you are doing :-)
final ListOfRubigoScreens<Screens> availableScreens = [
  RubigoScreen(
    Screens.splashScreen,
    SplashScreen(),
        () => holder.get(SplashController.new),
  ),
  RubigoScreen(
    Screens.s100,
    S100Screen(),
        () => holder.get(S100Controller.new),
  ),
  RubigoScreen(
    Screens.s200,
    S200Screen(),
        () => holder.get(S200Controller.new),
  ),
  RubigoScreen(
    Screens.s300,
    S300Screen(),
        () => holder.get(S300Controller.new),
  ),
];
```

Create a `RubigoRouter` and pass the `availableScreens` and splash screen.

```dart

final rubigoRouter = RubigoRouter<Screens>(
  availableScreens: availableScreens,
  splashScreenId: Screens.splashScreen,
);
```

Create a `RubigoRouterDelegate`, and pass it the `rubigoRouter`.

```dart

final routerDelegate = RubigoRouterDelegate(
  rubigoRouter: rubigoRouter,
);
```

Create a function that holds your initialization code and that returns the first screen.

```dart
Future<Screens> initAndGetFirstScreen() async {
  //Initialize your app here.
  //Create objects with your favorite dependency injection framework
  //and store them in your favorite service locator.
  return Screens.s100;
}
```

Create a `RubigoMaterialApp`, pass the `initAndGetFirstScreen` and `routerDelegate`.

```dart
main() {
  runApp(
    RubigoMaterialApp(
      initAndGetFirstScreen: initAndGetFirstScreen,
      routerDelegate: routerDelegate,
    ),
  );
}
```

### Setting up screens

You can use any widget as a screen widget.

If you add the `RubigoScreenMixin`, you can access the controller of your page directly in your
code. This controller is wired up during the initialization phase.

### example usage

```
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: controller.onS200ButtonPressed,
  child: const Text('Push S200'),
)
```

### Setting up controllers

You can use any class as a controller for your screen.

If you add the `RubigoControllerMixin`, you can access the router of you app directly in your code.
The router is wired up during the initialization phase.

#### Navigation events

Each controller with the `RubigoControllerMixin` gets access to the following navigation events:

```dart
@override
Future<void> onTop(RubigoChangeInfo<Screens> changeInfo) async {}

@override
Future<void> willShow(RubigoChangeInfo<Screens> changeInfo) async {}

@override
Future<void> isShown(RubigoChangeInfo<Screens> changeInfo) async {}

@override
Future<bool> mayPop() => Future.value(true);
```

The `onTop` event allows further navigation. After navigating and finishing all events, the Flutter
framework is informed about the new state of the screen stack. This will result in a single page
transition, from the old screen to the new screen.

The application logic can use the data provided in the `RubigoChangeInfo` to decide what to do next.

```dart
enum EventType {
  push,
  pop,
  popTo,
  replaceStack,
}

class RubigoChangeInfo<SCREEN_ID extends Enum> {
  const RubigoChangeInfo(this.eventType,
      this.previousScreen,
      this.screenStack,);

  final EventType eventType;
  final Screens? previousScreen;
  final List<Screens> screenStack;
}

```

### Navigating from controller code

If the controller has the `RubigoControllerMixin, you can manipulate the stack with these functions.

```
await rubigoRouter.pop();
await rubigoRouter.popTo(screenId);
await rubigoRouter.push(screenId);
await rubigoRouter.replaceStack(screens);
rubigoRouter.remove(screenId);
```

### Check if the app is busy

The `RubigoRouter` can be used to mark and track wether the app is busy and should accept user
interaction. By default, the navigator places an `IgnorePointer` widget above the app, while the app
is marked as busy. This prevents the user from tampering with the app with touch events, while the
app is busy. Be careful that keyboard events are not blocked by this mechanism.

Check if the app is busy.

```
if (!rubigoRouter.busyService.isBusy) {
//Do something only when the app is not busy
}
```

Mark the app busy while some code executes:

```
await rubigoRouter.busyService.busyWrapper(() async {
  //Do something lengthy here that the use may not interrupt.
});
```

If you want to get notified when the app is marked as busy you can use the notifier.

```dart

final notifier = rubigoRouter.busyService.notifier;
```

All stack manipulation functions have the optional parameter `ignoreWhenBusy`. You can use this if
you only want to perform the navigation when the app is not busy. This is useful if you wire up a
button pressed event directly to a navigating function.

```dart
Future<void> onS200ButtonPressed() async {
  await rubigoRouter.push(Screens.s200, ignoreWhenBusy: true);
}
```

## Additional information

I am using this way of working screens, controllers and navigation with Flutter apps since 2020.
But the first implementation goes back to WindowsCE. It always served me well and has never let me
down.

For issues or pull request, go to the repository on GitHub.

Happy navigating!
